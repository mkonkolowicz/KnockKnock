            Generic implementation of object pooling pattern with predefined pool size limit. The main
            purpose is that limited number of frequently used objects can be kept in the pool for
            further recycling.
            
            Notes: 
            1) it is not the goal to keep all returned objects. Pool is not meant for storage. If there
               is no space in the pool, extra returned objects will be dropped.
            
            2) it is implied that if object was obtained from a pool, the caller will return it back in
               a relatively short time. Keeping checked out objects for long durations is ok, but 
               reduces usefulness of pooling. Just new up your own.
            
            Not returning objects to the pool in not detrimental to the pool's work, but is a bad practice. 
            Rationale: 
               If there is no intent for reusing the object, do not use pool - just use "new".

            Removes an object from leak tracking.  
            
            This is called when an object is returned to the pool.  It may also be explicitly 
            called if an object allocated from the pool is intentionally not being returned
            to the pool.  This can be of use with pooled arrays if the consumer wants to 
            return a larger array to the pool than was originally allocated.
